description: Design a system change as a verified bridge from a 100%-resolved beginning state to a defined desired state. Locks current reality with zero assumptions, finds the simplest viable path (reusing existing infrastructure), verifies every cross-system dependency live, and runs the full design-rigor pass — so the build can be one-shot with zero scope change. Middle step in the /memo → /prd → /build lifecycle.

# /prd

**Definition of done:** A PRD makes the gap between **where we are** and **where we want to be** so completely understood and verified that the build cannot surprise us. Its exit condition is a hard guarantee: **`/build` can be executed in one shot, with zero scope change.** Every assumption about the current state is resolved to 100%, every cross-system dependency is probed live and confirmed to respond as assumed, and every design check has passed — *before a single build action is taken.* This is **Gate 2: "I've designed it right."**

Why the bar is this high: if anything is discovered mid-build that forces a course change, it triggers rework that cascades through everything downstream. The cheapest place to find that problem is here, in the PRD, before anything is committed. We do **all** the verification up front so `/build` becomes pure execution — no planning, no scope decisions, no surprises.

**The PRD must be self-contained.** A big memo + PRD can consume a lot of context — so often the build runs in a *fresh session*. The emitted PRD document has to carry everything a new session needs to one-shot the build, with **zero** reliance on the conversation that produced it. The test: hand the PRD file (and nothing else) to a session with no memory of this work — can it build the whole thing without asking a single clarifying question? If anything required to build lives only in the chat — a decision, a verified response shape, a "we agreed to…" — it isn't done until it's written into the PRD.

**This PRD always derives from a memo,** but the memo is not load-bearing: when ground truth gathered in Phase 1 contradicts the memo's assumed solution, the PRD is shaped by reality and the memo gets revised — never deferred to.

## Core disciplines (read before starting)

- **Zero assumptions about the beginning state.** Any variance in the start state corrupts the entire downstream build. The current-state picture must be at 100% resolution, observed from live systems — never inferred from docs or memory alone.
- **Reuse over rebuild.** The most common failure: a session doesn't fully understand what already exists, so it builds redundant new tables/workflows instead of small additions to existing infrastructure. Every new artifact must justify why an existing one couldn't be extended.
- **Reduce, don't merge.** Find the *smallest* change that bridges the gap. Do not incorporate every piece of context the agents return. Synthesis-by-merge is the enemy.
- **Agents explore, one mind designs.** Agents gather ground truth and propose whole-solution candidates. They never each own a *slice* of the build and scope it independently — that fragments the design and forces reconciliation after. The main session is the single designer.

## Usage

```
/prd [link to memo or description of what to design]
/prd design the auto-categorizer (see _admin/memos/auto_categorize.md)
/prd scope the new monthly spending dashboard
```

## When to Use

- After a `/memo` has cleared Gate 1 and recommended a build
- When a significant system change needs architectural design before implementation
- When multiple systems, entities, or boundaries will be affected

## When NOT to Use

- Bug fixes or config tweaks (use `/quick-fix`)
- Strategic decisions not yet clarified (use `/memo` first)
- The change is trivial (single table, single workflow, no boundary crossings, nothing to verify — go straight to `/build`)

---

## Phase 1: LOCK THE BEGINNING STATE (100% resolution, zero assumptions)

**Goal:** A perfect, verified picture of exactly what we are working from — and what already exists that we can reuse.

Spawn **one ground-truth agent per system/area the build touches.** This is the safe place to parallelize: these agents *observe and report facts* — they do not design, so dividing by area causes no fragmentation. The main session reassembles their reports into **one** coherent picture.

Generalize the agents to the actual systems involved. Common areas (assign whichever apply):

| Area | What the agent verifies (facts only, no recommendations) |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automations / workflows** | Observe each live automation directly — its configuration, connections, credentials, current data flow, and which ones this touches. |
| **Data stores** | Inspect a real sample of the live data for every relevant store — field names, types, relationships, value conventions, indexes, stored procedures, views. Observe, never infer from docs. |
| **App / frontend** | Routes, API handlers, env config, deploy state. |
| **Code / scripts** | Modules, entry points, dependencies, current behavior. |
| **External services / APIs** | What endpoints exist, auth, request/response shapes actually returned. |
| **Context & contracts** | CONTEXT.md, `system_contracts.md`, decision log, the triggering memo, memory, and `_admin/_archive/` for prior projects that touched these systems (read the archived PRD — original design decisions and lessons live there). **If the workspace has no standard living docs to read, stop and run `/new-workspace` (brownfield) first** — a PRD can't resolve the beginning state against a documentation substrate that doesn't exist. |

Use the right observation tool for the workspace's declared stack — load its tool-skill where one exists. Observe live state; never infer.

**Every Phase 1 agent must also return a reusable-assets inventory** for its area: existing tables, fields, automations, stored procedures, contracts, and patterns that are *adjacent to this build and could be extended.* This inventory is what prevents redundant rebuilds in Phase 7.

**Wait for all agents. Reassemble into one briefing:**

```
BEGINNING STATE (verified):

Systems involved:
- [system] — [current state, key facts]

Schema / data:
- [table] — [columns, relationships, conventions]

Existing contracts:
- [boundary] — [current shape]

REUSABLE ASSETS (already exist — candidates to extend, not rebuild):
- [table/automation/stored procedure/pattern] — [what it does, how it might be extended]

Constraints from prior decisions:
- [decision #N] — [what it constrains]

Open assumptions still unverified: [list — must be empty before Phase 6 completes]
```

**Walk the picture with the user.** Confirm understanding. Flag anything that contradicts the memo's assumed solution — revise the memo now, don't carry assumptions forward.

**Gate:** zero assumptions remain about what exists. If any fact is inferred rather than observed, go verify it.

---

## Phase 2: DEFINE THE DESIRED STATE

**Goal:** One clear statement of "solved looks like X," pulled from the memo's success definition.

- State the desired end state in one paragraph — observable and concrete.
- **Beginning state + desired state = the gap.** Everything downstream bridges exactly this gap and nothing more.

---

## Phase 3: MINIMUM-VIABLE DERIVATION (mandatory gate)

**The most important step. Do not skip. Do not let the memo's proposed solution carry forward unchallenged.**

Before any path agent runs, YOU answer in writing:

> Given the verified beginning state — **including everything in the reusable-assets inventory** — what is the single smallest change that bridges the gap to the desired state?

Write it as one paragraph. Be ruthlessly minimal: one field, one step, one query, one extension of an existing component — the literal smallest. The minimal version is minimal precisely **because** it reuses what already exists. No "and also," no "while we're here."

Then ask:
- **Does the smallest version actually reach the desired state?** (Re-read the gap — does minimal close it?)
- **Does it have a foreseen downstream break?** (Blast-radius check: which consumers / contracts / tables does it touch? Is anything documented today that this breaks?)
- **If both answers are clean → the minimal version IS the PRD.** Skip Phase 4 and 5, proceed to Phase 6 (verify it live), then Phase 7. Do NOT manufacture sections to make the PRD feel "complete."
- **Only if the minimal version genuinely cannot reach the desired state** (name the specific failure mode) do you proceed to multi-path generation.

Present the derivation to the user and confirm before proceeding.

---

## Phase 4: GENERATE CANDIDATE PATHS (only if minimal is insufficient)

There are a thousand ways to bridge a gap across systems with dependencies. When minimal can't, get independent takes before committing.

Spawn fresh-context agents, each handed the **same complete picture**: beginning state + reusable-assets inventory + desired state + the named failure mode that ruled out minimal.

**Each agent designs the ENTIRE bridge, end-to-end, from a different angle. No agent owns a slice.** This is the explicit guard against fragmentation — every proposal is a complete path from start state to desired state, not a component someone else has to integrate.

Assign one angle per agent:

| Angle | Framing (applied to the whole bridge) |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| **Subtraction** | What is the smallest set of edits to existing artifacts that bridges the whole gap? |
| **Reuse** | What existing pattern already solves a structurally identical problem — apply it across the whole bridge? |
| **Elimination** | Can the gap be made not-exist by changing an upstream condition instead of building? |
| **External** | Is there an existing tool/service/feature that bridges the gap so we build less? |

Launch 2-4 in parallel. Each returns one complete path: the changes required, what it touches, every component, and why it's the simplest viable bridge from that angle.

---

## Phase 5: GRADE & SELECT

**Goal:** Pick the best complete path. **You do NOT merge.**

Evaluate each path against: simplicity, reuse of existing infra, blast radius, and how cleanly it reaches the desired state. The asymmetry between angles is what surfaces the minimum — merging destroys it. If two paths are equally simple but differ in tradeoff, that's a design decision for the user. If none are simple enough, the gap was framed wrong — re-frame.

Present the candidates and the selected path to the user. Confirm before proceeding.

---

## Phase 6: MAP COMPONENTS + VERIFY EVERY DEPENDENCY LIVE (the one-shot core)

**Goal:** Prove the end-to-end process works *before* committing to build. This is what makes one-shot possible.

1. **Enumerate every component** of the chosen path — every table/column to add or change, every workflow/node, every contract, every endpoint, every handoff.
2. **Probe every cross-system dependency live.** For each webhook, service, endpoint, RPC, and external API the path depends on: actually call it / inspect it and confirm it responds exactly as the design assumes. Do not assume a response shape — observe it.
3. **Record a validation log:**

```
VALIDATION LOG:
| # | Assumption the design rests on | How tested | Result | Status |
|---|--------------------------------|------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Webhook X returns {field: type} | Fired test payload | Returned {…} | ✅ confirmed |
| 2 | Table Y has column Z (uuid)     | SELECT … LIMIT 5  | Present, uuid | ✅ confirmed |
| 3 | Service W accepts batch writes  | …                 | …      | ❌ does not — revise path |
```

**Exit:** every assumption in the log is ✅ confirmed and the entire end-to-end path is verified to work. Any ❌ sends you back to revise the design (Phase 4/5) — better here than mid-build. **The "Open assumptions" list from Phase 1 must now be empty.**

---

## Phase 7: DESIGN RIGOR PASS (every check must pass — same rigor, session-run)

**Goal:** On the chosen, verified design, run every mental model. The session does this work; the human supplies judgment where flagged. Document pass/fail for each in the PRD. **Do not proceed until all pass.**

The three exit artifacts (the drawable picture of the design) are the centerpiece:

- **Domain model (ERD)** — every entity and how they relate (1:1, 1:many, many:many). Which exist vs. are new.
- **Value stream** — how value flows from trigger to outcome, with every cross-system handoff marked.
- **System narrative (C4 Level 1)** — one paragraph, plain language: what this system does and how its pieces connect. If you can't tell it in a paragraph, the design isn't clear yet.

Then the checks:

| # | Check | What it enforces |
|---|-------|------------------|
| 1 | **Entity-Relationship** | All entities identified, relationships mapped (the ERD). |
| 2 | **State lifecycle** | Every core entity has a `status` field (string/enum, **not** booleans) and a full state map — *including the states you're tempted to skip* (paused, disputed, archived, error). Beginners omit these entirely. |
| 3 | **Entity lifecycle** | Every entity's create→…→terminal path is mapped. |
| 4 | **Transition timestamps** | Every state transition has a timestamp field (`matched_at`, `approved_at`). |
| 5 | **Value stream** | Flow traced end-to-end, trigger to outcome. |
| 6 | **Domain boundaries** | Every system has clear ownership, one interface point (table/webhook/RPC/API), and an explicit contract (produces + consumes, with field shapes). |
| 7 | **Output isolation** | Each system writes only to its own output; no system mutates another's data. Cross-system reads via views/contracts. |
| 8 | **Idempotency** | Every operation touching money or critical state can safely run twice. |
| 9 | **Reuse over rebuild** | **Every new artifact carries a one-line reuse rejection: "Couldn't extend `existing_thing` because ___."** If you can't write it, extend the existing artifact instead. New tables/workflows are built minimum-viable and most-efficient. |
| 10 | **Blast radius** | Affected systems listed; unaffected systems explicitly confirmed; the impact map is complete. |
| 11 | **Pre-mortem** | "3 months out, this failed badly — what went wrong?" Top 3 failure scenarios with defenses. |
| 12 | **Expand-and-contract** | If modifying existing contracts, the migration path is defined (add new → migrate consumers → remove old). |

If any check fails, fix the design before continuing.

---

## Phase 8: ONE-SHOT READINESS GATE

**Goal:** The final test before handing to `/build`.

Ask, explicitly: **Could a fresh session — given only this PRD file, with zero memory of this conversation — execute the build in one shot with zero scope change?**

- Is every component specified concretely enough to build without a judgment call?
- Is every dependency verified (validation log all ✅)?
- Is every design check passed?
- **Is every decision, agreed shape, and verified response actually written into the PRD** — nothing load-bearing left in the chat? (Re-read as if you've never seen this project: is anything missing?)
- Is there any "we'll figure that out during build" anywhere? (If yes — it isn't done. Figure it out now.)

If anything is unresolved, name it and resolve it. Only when the answer is an unqualified **yes** is the PRD done.

### Where to save

- `{workspace}/_admin/prds/{project-name}/{project_name}_prd.md` (snake_case file name matching the project).
- Create the project directory if needed. Drafts may live in `_admin/prds/_drafts/` until approved.
- Memos stay in `_admin/memos/` — link to the memo by relative path in the **Memo** field. One memo may spawn multiple PRDs.
- Completed projects are archived to `_admin/_archive/{project-name}/` by `/build` at close.

### Present for approval

The PRD must be approved before `/build`. Confirm with the user:
- Does this match your intent?
- Are work items scoped by boundary?
- Any concerns about the pre-mortem scenarios?
- **Is the one-shot readiness section an honest, unqualified yes?**

**Mark status "Approved" once confirmed.**

---

## Close: hand off or pause

The approved PRD at `{workspace}/_admin/prds/{project-name}/{project_name}_prd.md` is self-contained — it carries everything `/build` needs, with nothing load-bearing left in chat. Don't auto-advance. Ask the user explicitly:

> **PRD cleared Gate 2 — one-shot ready.** Want to proceed to **`/build`** now — or pick it up in a new session? (A fresh session continues with `/build` against the PRD file alone.)

---

## Principles

- **The beginning state is the foundation.** Any variance there corrupts everything downstream. 100% resolution, observed from live systems, zero assumptions.
- **Verify before you commit.** Every dependency is probed live in the PRD, not discovered in the build. The validation log is the proof.
- **One-shot is the exit.** If `/build` would have to make a single scope decision, the PRD isn't done.
- **Self-contained or it's not done.** The PRD carries everything; a fresh session builds from it alone. Anything load-bearing left in the chat is a defect, because the build often runs in a new session.
- **Reuse over rebuild.** Extend what exists. A new artifact you can't justify against the reusable-assets inventory is redundant.
- **Reduce, don't merge.** The smallest bridge that reaches the desired state — never the union of every agent's idea.
- **Agents explore, one mind designs.** Parallelize observation freely; never distribute the design.
- **Boundaries first, internals second.** Get the boundaries right and the internals follow.
- **Explicit over implicit.** Every contract, boundary, and state is written down. If it's not in the PRD, it doesn't exist.
